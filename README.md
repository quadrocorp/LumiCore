# 🌌 **Lumi — The Cosmic Command Center for Telegram Bots**
> **Phase Status**: 🚀 **Active Development — v1.0-alpha “Photon” Under Construction**

---

## 🌠 Vision

In a digital universe teeming with chatter, automation, and endless streams of messages, **Lumi** rises as your guiding star—a luminous, container-native command platform engineered to **orchestrate, illuminate, and empower** your Telegram bot fleet like never before.

No more fragmented scripts. No more blind deployments.  
Only **clarity**, **control**, and **cosmic-scale simplicity**.

## 🧬 System Architecture — The Lumi Constellation

Lumi isn’t just a dashboard—it’s an ecosystem of purpose-built stellar components, each orbiting around one mission: *seamless bot sovereignty*.

### 🌟 **LumiCore** — The Celestial Engine
A high-performance Go backend that acts as the gravitational heart of the system. It commands Docker, brokers WebSocket streams, and enforces security with zero-trust discipline.

### 🌌 **Lumi UI** — The Observational Deck
A sleek, reactive React interface that renders real-time telemetry into intuitive cosmic visualizations. Built for speed, aesthetics, and operational serenity.

### ⚡ **LumiForge** — The Forge of Intelligence *(Future)*
A dynamic code-generation nexus that auto-instruments bots with telemetry hooks, turning raw bots into observant, metric-aware entities.

### 📡 **LumiBeacon** — The Pulse of the Fleet
A stream-processing telemetry nexus that aggregates performance, message flow, and health signals across your entire bot armada—instantly, continuously, gracefully.

### 🔥 **LumiSpark** — The Simulator Star
A dedicated test and debugging companion that generates **realistic mock data** and simulates bot behaviors under controlled conditions. LumiSpark empowers developers to validate Lumi’s integrations, stress-test dashboards, and debug edge cases—**without deploying a single live bot**.  
As mock data generators are essential for simulating real-world scenarios securely and efficiently during development , LumiSpark ensures your platform evolves in a safe, observable sandbox before touching production.

## 🗺️ Stellar Roadmap

### 🕯️ **v1.0-alpha — “Photon”**
*Light-speed control. Zero friction.*

- ✅ **Bot Lifecycle Mastery**: Launch, pause, and purge bot containers with a single click
- 📦 **Dynamic Bot Registration**: Add or remove bots from your fleet without redeploying
- 📊 **Live Resource Orbs**: Real-time CPU & RAM vitals rendered in radiant, interactive widgets
- 🔐 **Fort Knox Auth**: JWT-backed, session-hardened authentication with role-aware safeguards
- 🔥 **LumiSpark Integration (Alpha)**: Basic mock bot telemetry injection for UI validation

> *Photon doesn’t just emit light—it defines visibility.*

---

### 💫 **v2.0-beta — “Quantum”** *(Coming Soon)*
*Where observation becomes insight.*

- 🛠️ **LumiForge Integration**: Auto-inject telemetry probes into new or existing bots
- 📈 **Throughput Constellations**: Track messages/minute, hour, day, month—mapped across time and bot identity
- 🌐 **Multi-Bot Correlation**: Compare behavior across your fleet like constellations in the night sky
- 💥 **Advanced LumiSpark**: Simulate traffic bursts, error states, and message floods for resilience testing

---

### 🌈 **v3.0 — “Aurora”** *(Horizon Phase)*
*The dawn of real-time awareness.*

- 📜 **Live Log Nebula**: Stream filtered, color-coded logs directly in-browser—no SSH required
- 🚨 **Anomaly Detection**: AI-assisted warnings for traffic spikes, crashes, or silent failures
- 🧭 **Custom Dashboard Skies**: Let users design their own telemetry skies with drag-and-drop widgets
- ⚡ **LumiSpark Debugger Console**: Visual replay of simulated bot sessions with step-through inspection
