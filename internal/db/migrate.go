package db

// Author == quadrocorp
// Version == v1.0-alpha || Photon
// NOTE: Photon is the alpha version of this project, and implies an MVP.

// As a future feature i also might add methods to migrate DB from one place to
// another, with automatic change of the configuration.

// Also as a thought, I could make methods to migrate from one dialect to another, or maybe
// even to non SQL databases.
